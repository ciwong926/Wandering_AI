# Wandering_AI


1. Make sure you have Processing Software downloaded on your computer.

2. Click on the pde file inside the folder. If you have Processing on your computer code a window with code should appear. 

3. Note that I coded this with the Java version of Processing. In the top right hand corner of the window where a language is selected, make sure that it says "Java". If not select Java from the drop down.

4. Running wander_steering:

    A. Running the better version ( customized random binomial ). The variables "limit" should be zero, "neg" should be false, "count" should be 20, "zero" should be 0.5. Go to the bottom of the setup() function to make sure this is the case. Then, click the run button at the top left hand of the window. 

    B. Running the bad version ( standard random binomial ). For this to run properly, the variables "limit", "count", and "zero" need to equal zero. Go to the bottom of the setup() function and modify these variables to equal these values if they are not set that way. Then, click the run button at the top left hand of the window. 

8. Close the running program by clicking the red 'x' in the top left hand corner. 

9. Close the code file by clicking the red 'x' in the top left hand corner.
